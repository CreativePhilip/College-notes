\section{Passing}
There will be 2 exams / tests.
There will be weekly lists of tasks to do for Exercises. 

\section{Curriculum}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1/3 of the course is basic logic formulas, useful for simplifying if-else comparisons
	\item 1/3 will cover information what will be helpful to courses on databases, machine learning \& artificial intelligence
	\item 1/3 will cover details on semantics that will be useful on the masters level
\end{itemize}

\section{What is logic?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Logic is defined as formal apparatus for reasoning.
	\item There are two elements: \\ - Formal language - a set of sentences built with symbols \\ - Semantics - a method of adding meaning to them
\end{itemize}

\section{Sentences in logic}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic symbols, variables: a,b,c
	\item Logical connectives, operators:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item OR (alternative, disjunction) $\lor$
		\item AND (conjunction) $\land$
		\item NOT (negation) $\lnot$
		\item IF ... THEN (implication) $\implies$
		\item TRUE IF AND ONLY IF $ \iff $
		\item Tautology $ \top $
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Logic Laws}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $(a \land b) \lor c \equiv (a \lor c) \land (b \lor c)$
	\item $(a \lor b) \land c \equiv (a \land c) \lor (b \land c)$
	\item $\lnot (a \lor b) \equiv \lnot a \land \lnot b$
	\item $\lnot (a \land b) \equiv \lnot a \lor \lnot b$
\end{itemize}
\section{The basics of Set Theory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no formal definition. It's a collection of objects.
	\item The modern approach to sets was developed mainly in the 19th century by Cantor and others
	\item Since then it has been extended and other theories had been proposed
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Notation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $X = \{1, 2, 3\}; Y=\{Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun\}$
	\item $\emptyset$ - empty set
	\item $\mathbb{N}$ - set of Natural Numbers
	\item $\mathbb{Z}$ - set of all Integers
	\item $\mathbb{R}$ - set of all Real Numbers
	\item $x \in X$ x is an element of set X
	\item $X \subseteq Y$ all elements of X ale elements of Y
	\item $X \subset Y$ X is a proper subset of Y, that is all elements in X are also elements of Y and $X \neq Y$13
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Power Sets}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We use the notation $2^s$ to denote the power-set of S, that is the set of all subsets of S
	\item Any subset R of $2^s$ is a set family of s
	\item If S has n elements, then $2^s$ has $2^n$ elements.
	\item We use notation card(a) or $|A|$ or \#A
	\item For any finite A the following is true: $card(2^A) = 2^{card(A)}$
\end{itemize}
